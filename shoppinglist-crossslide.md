# Shoppinglist Cross slide
To make a cross-slide with an X axis and an Y axis you need some rails or diffent thing to slide the equipment. You also need something to adjust it with. You may adjust it with a threaded rod, espesially if the lathe is small. However you would get a much more precise mesaurment and a easier slide with a ballbering roller.

Ok, so you first need both a ballbearing roller and some rails at the length of the bed.
### Ball screw
1000mm for X-axis. Tip: Buy a set with ball bearing, and everything, then all match together
400mm for Y axis. Tip: Buy a set with ball bearing, and everything, then all match together

### Rails
1000mm linear rail SBR20 for the X-axis (SBR20 is a 20mm thick rail) (perhaps SBR16 could do the thrick as well).
400mm linear rail SBR20 for the Y-axis (perhaps SBR16 could do the thrick as well, espesially when it's a shorter distance).
4 + 4 Bearing Blocks. These are often sold together with the rail, ensuring that they are fit together.

### Tool post and tools

## Handles
Handles you could make on the Lathe when it's done, you need a steel plate, like 100mm*100mm that is a bit thick, 5-10mm or more.
